#Fizz Buzz

By [Codurance](https://www.codurance.com/katas/fizzbuzz).

Follow the below instructions using the [three rules of Test-Driven Development](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/modern-c-programming/9781941222423/f_0055.html):

1. Write production code only to pass a failing unit test.
2. Write no more of a unit test than sufficient to fail (compilation failures are failures).
3. Write no more production code than necessary to pass the one failing unit test.


##Instructions

Write a function that takes positive integers and outputs their string representation.

Your function should comply with the following additional rules:

    If the number is a multiple of three, return the string "Fizz".
    If the number is a multiple of five, return the string "Buzz".
    If the number is a multiple of both three and five, return the string "FizzBuzz".

For example, given the numbers from 1 to 15 in order, the function would return:

1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
